      <p id="p2">  
        After college, I landed a job at a screen printing shop in Atlanta.  I learned so much over the next few years about design and printing.  However, Atlanta was changing, and I decided I needed to move on.  I ended up in a college town in Kentucky and opened and ran my own print shop for a few years.  After running the shop, and growing tired of a small town, decided to make the move out west and stopped in Salt Lake City, and Portland before ending up in Seattle.  I worked as a carpenter and also did graphic design/traveling screenprinting work for a couple of years, but decided to focus on the screenprinting job, until recently.

        I hope to be able to combine my experience in the arts and technology.
